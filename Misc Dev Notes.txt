Packed Addons

	Packed Addons will not be uploaded to the dropbox due to space restraints.
	If you need one or all addons packed, notify Scorch052, SpaceNavy, or TheDog
	
.TGA Files

	Leaving .tga files in the directories of any addon is redundant
	as they are automatically converted when packed for the first time.
	Please remove .tga files once they have been duplicated as .paas and do not reference .tga files.
	Also, .pngs will also work just as well
	
Normal Maps

	All of Stirls' normal maps need to modified to have the green channel inverted

Specular

	Turns out with Specular maps (SMDI) I was supposed to combine the specular and gloss maps into one file.
	Red Channel - White
	Green Channel - Specular
	Blue Channel - Gloss
