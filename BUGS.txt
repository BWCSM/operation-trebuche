Weapons
	Illumination torch doesn't work on the SMG
	SMG Tracers dont work

Units
	UNSC BDUs do not have wounded skins

Vehicles
	Warthog and Genet brake lights do not work
	Attack Pelican is missing visible rocket pods
	Falcon's light is useless; just blinds the pilot. Lights are actually located on the front of each wing
	The pelican scripts need admin intervention to work, and then said attach script is a pain in the ass to get working, I think it has something to do with looking/aiming at the hog.
	AA hog fire point should revolve (model.cfg)
	^ Same for M910 PDN

Objects
	Final Dawn has no collision

Core
	Calendar/date should be expanded to allow for 26th century years
