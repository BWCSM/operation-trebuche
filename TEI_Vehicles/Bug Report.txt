TEI_Vehicles

	/// HEV
	-script suite needs to be fully tested (not included in PBO) [Scorch052]
	-needs proper Geo and Contact LODs
	-needs proper rv mats (I think the shine actually fits the HEV in this case)
	-Change to "Air" class or give HEV its own class because it technically isn't an aircraft?
	-should try to create a new "vehicle" instead of inheriting from the ATV. causes a few issues by not being its own object
	-emergency door not working
	-player dies upon ejecting (related to the "eject" option)
	-missing icon in editor
	-remove horn
	-remove option to "turn on" the vehicle
	-crater floats slightly above the ground
	-sounds need to be defined in config, otherwise cause error for "not found" aka missing path

	/// Warthog
	-add variants
	-fire geo lod needed for the attachments (apc cover, gun, etc)
	-sounds extremely quiet in driver seat
	-front wheels turn too sharply (animation and turning radius)
	-lights are way too bright
	-adjust turning radius to match wheel turning radius
	-Icons needed
	-Turret barrel twisting animation missing
	-Editor/map icon too large?
	-Warthog too illuminated RVMat issue?
	-missing shell ejection out of MG turret
	-missing camo2 selection for turret variants
	-when a player is in, the warthog locks and no one can get inside

	/// Pelican
	-needs rvmats
	-config needs to be cleaned up
	-window texture needs to be fixed to have the mirrored windows
	-cockpit gadgets not working, honestly wouldnt bother with it as the cockpit will be overhauled later
	-gear don't show as retracted in MP for other people
	-pelican needs jesus... needs a lot of love if we ever want it in game
	-pelican wreck texture needs to be blackened out (green wings)
