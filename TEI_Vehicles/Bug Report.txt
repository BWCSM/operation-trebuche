TEI_Vehicles

	-add retextured UNSC HEMTT "M1087 Stallion"
	-add retextured UNSC Zamak "M1015 Mule"

	/// HEV
	-script suite needs to be fully tested [Scorch052]
	-needs proper Geo and Contact LODs
	-should try to create a new "vehicle" instead of inheriting from the ATV (why not just make it an object instead of a vehicle?)
	-emergency door not working
	-player dies upon ejecting (related to the "eject" option and position of exit)
	-missing icon in editor
	-remove horn
	-remove option to "turn on" the vehicle
	-crater floats slightly above the ground (possible cause of exit death- player clips the ground and dies)
	-sounds need to be defined in config, otherwise cause error for "not found" aka missing path

	/// Warthog
	-fire geo lod needed for the attachments (apc cover, gun, etc)
	-sounds extremely quiet in driver seat
	-Icons needed
	-Turret barrel twisting animation missing
	-Editor/map icon too large
	-Warthog too illuminated RVMat issue?
	-MG turret middle pip sight needs to be moved to the right very slightly about 1 or 2 cm (shoots to the right)
	-shell ejection memory point needs adjusted and delay needs fixed
	-add scope view and crosshairs to PiP screen on Gauss hog

>>>!!! when a player is in, the warthog locks and no one can get inside (Multiplayer tested) !!!<<<

	/// Pelican
	-cockpit gadgets not working, honestly wouldnt bother with it as the cockpit will be overhauled later
	-pelican wreck texture needs to be blackened out (green wings)
