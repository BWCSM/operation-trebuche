	/// HEV
	-script suite needs to be fully tested [Scorch052]
	-needs proper Geo and Contact LODs
	-should try to create a new "vehicle" instead of inheriting from the ATV (why not just make it an object instead of a vehicle?)
	-emergency door not working
	-player dies upon ejecting (related to the "eject" option and position of exit)
	-missing icon in editor
	-remove horn
	-remove option to "turn on" the vehicle

	/// Pelican
	-needs rvmats
	-config needs to be cleaned up
