the hand animations are WIP, i included the 3 source file for the animations. im having an issue with my rig and im in the middle of an rig overhaul, 
i believe the issue to be a relationship between the T-pose and 0.000000 animation, i believe there is a relationship but i need to adress it in my rig.

The rocket launcher is too high ATM, causing the wrist breaking animation, fixable. 

i will revisit this sometime in the next week after i get my rig worked out.
