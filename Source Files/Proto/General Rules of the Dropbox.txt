OBVIOUS RULES ABOUT THE DROPBOX ACCOUNT:

-Do not under any circumstances edit another person's files without their consent.

-This Dropbox account only has about 2.5Gb of avaliable storage space so please do not upload a large amount of files, especially with large file sizes.

-Only upload relevant data (ex. no personal files, work files, school files, etc).

-Relevant data such as reference images have a tendency to take up a lot of space. Keep them to yourself for the time being until we can get more Dropbox storage.

-If you have any problems at all, contact TheDog88 or SpaceNavy.
