--- TheEvanCat's Folder ---

So you found yourself in an empty white void. But a bastion of blue shimmered in the distance. You clicked on it. And now, you're here.

Yeah, the rug might be shag carpet but why the hell do you care? It's America. I do what I want. No, I don't have a matching '70s porn mustache. On a related note, keep out of that smut folder if you don't want to discover a whole new branch of pornography unknown to modern science. Like, for real. It'll ruin every boner you'll ever have. Ever.

I'm as organized as a Nazi lumberjack in here, so my file labyrinth should be easy to traverse to find what you're looking for.

I mostly do insurgent gear, meaning that you're going to find badguys in there. Keep looking if you want to get someone else's stuff.

Other than that, just talk to me on Steam if there are questions to be had. I don't mind if you take stuff and screw around locally on your computer. Just don't come back and overwrite things, mkay?

Also, please don't go into my porn and world domination folders. Like, for real. It won't be a good time.
