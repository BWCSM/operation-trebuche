Included in every .rar this point forward will be various LODs.

If there are specific poly counts for each LOD, let me know. Right now I have LOD1 75% base mesh, LOD2 50%, LOD3 25% and LOD4 (if applicable) as low as it can go before the model is mush.

Also included are Geo LODs, they are no more than 100 polies (avg 20-40).

Please use LOD3 for shadows and fire LODs, they should be sufficient.

Notes (in case anyone leaves them):
