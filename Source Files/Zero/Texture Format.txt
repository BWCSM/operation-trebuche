All .PAA textures should be the correct format so there is no bs when putting them into the game. I've come up with a naming convention to keep everything sorted: 

GUN_GUNOBJECT_TEXTURETYPE
Ex.:
M6G_M6G_Ca
M6G_Scope_Co

Please let me know if you want me to leave out PNGs and just keep the TGAs and PAAs.

Notes (in case anyone leaves them):
