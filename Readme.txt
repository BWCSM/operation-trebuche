FAQ

Q-Why does my game crash on start with no error message?
A-There could be a multitude of reasons. TEI is not configured to be compatible with many mods.
This doesn't mean it isn't compatible, just that unforeseen issues may arise. Try launching with no mods but @TEI and @CBA_A3.

Q-Whenever I select a weapon in VA, my game crashes! Why?
A-Make sure you are not running ASDG Joint Rails at any version below 0.13. If you are not running ASDG_JR, report this issue on the subreddit.

Q-How do the HEV Pods work?
A-The HEV pods use a custom function suite that automatically adds an action to every HEV spawned, allowing it to initiate the drop sequence.
For a detailed example, refer to the included template mission found in the @TEI folder.

Q-Where do I report bugs?
A-www.reddit.com/r/EridanusInsurrection
